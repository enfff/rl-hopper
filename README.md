## Python Virtual Environment

Start a virtual environment with Python 3.10.0, then install all the dependencies with

``` python
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## File description

**Available gym environments**

- **Source**: the hopper, whose mass torso value is shifted by one.
- **Target**: the hopper
- **Source UDR**: the hopper, whose mass torso value is shifted by one. Once the reset function is called, the hopper is assigned new masses uniformly and randomly generated
- **Source AA**: hopper, whose mass torso value is shifted by one. Once the reset function is called, the hopper, but the masses are generated by the Adversarial Agent

The some plots shows writing such as `source -> target`. That means that the agent has been trained on *source*, and is later tested on *target*.

**File description**

`task2.py` trains *source.mdl*

`task3.py` trains *target.mdl*, and and tests *source -> source*, *source -> target* and *target -> target*. Please note: if there's a file named `target.mdl`, it just tests it.

`task4.py` trains *udrsource.mdl*, and tests *udrsource -> target*. Please note: if there's a file named `udrsource.mdl`, it just tests it.

`train_multi_adversarial_agents.py`: Trains 5 different models, with seeds ranging from 1 to 5, and saves them. Run with `--help` to check all the available commands.

`test_adversarial_agent.py`: Tests *aasource -> target*. Run with `--help` to check all the available commands.
